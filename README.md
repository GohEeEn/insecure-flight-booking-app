## How to run this program

1. Decrypt encrypted sensitive properties
    - Encryption of sensitive properties inside file application.properties is enabled with [Jasypt](http://www.jasypt.org)
    - To generate the encoded credential value, go to maven library path ` ~/.m2/repository/org/jasypt/jasypt/1.9.0` on terminal (CLI)
    - Use the following command to run the JAR program to generate the encoded value
      ```
       java -cp jasypt-1.9.0.jar org.jasypt.intf.cli.JasyptPBEStringEncryptionCLI input="value" password=<key> algorithm=PBEWithMD5AndDES
      ```
        - __input__ - The value in string to be encoded
        - __password__ - The key for both encryption and decryption of the input
        - __algorithm__ - The encoding algorithm, that here we use a Password-Based version of DES Encryption algorithm, with the MD5 hash of the password as the encryption key
    - Jasypt reads all the properties from _application.properties_ or any classpath properties that you passed, with value prefix __ENC(__ and suffix __)__
    - The password is required to run this application, with the following Maven argument :

      `-Djasypt.encryptor.password=secretkey`

3. Open a terminal on the root directory of this project (ie. where this doc is stored)
4. Run the command `mvn clean install` to run tests and build the project
5. Run the command `mvn spring-boot:run` to run the Spring Boot application
6. **Note** that the first run of this web app will return certain `Exception` since initialization of database tables is not included in the relevant SQL script, while *those tables will be initialized automatically after those exceptions are thrown*. Thus, it will run smoothly after the first time.
7. Go to `http://localhost:<server.port>` to open the web application (setting can be done in `application.properties`)

    ```properties
    # 8080 by default
    server.port=<open_port>
    ```

8. To connect to the **h2** database, open up any browser and navigate to ***localhost:8080/h2-console***

- Click on **Advanced -> Proceed to localhost (unsafe)**.

## Introduction to this web application

Homepage is the first page you will always see when you open this application with `localhost:<server.port>`

![Homepage frontend for guest](img/Guest_1_Homepage.png)

1. Header of the navigation bar, also the link to homepage
2. Reservation retrieval form for any `guest` with their email address & reservation id
3. Club member registration link
4. Member login link
5. Flight search as a guest

### Member

1. Register a **Club Member Account** by clicking the `Register` link (3) in the upper right-hand corner.
2. Input the required details and click `Register` at the bottom of the form.
3. Upon returning to the login page, you can login as the created Member via the `Login` button (4) in the upper-right hand side of the page.
